Concepts which make programming easier.

Where do we begin?

We begin our mastery of computer technolgy by looking at a much older technology... 

Consider Fire.

//wav "Now don't try to kid me, mancub
I made a deal with you
What I desire is man's red fire
To make my dream come true
Now give me the secret, mancub
Cmon clue me what to do
Give me the power of man's red flower
So I can be like you"

Would you have been curious about those first terrifying illuminations? Would you have stayed in the darkness? ^for how long? ^forever? ^would that have meant leaving human society? ^in those times, would that have meant leaving humanity? 
Would it have seemed like a forbidden knowledge?^Forbidden by whom?^Did lighting a fire give shape to the darkness? 
/Or would it have felt right and normal?^ was life without this techology suddenly unimaginable? ^^^

These events are orders of magnitude older than history. 


In Greek mythology, the Titan Prometheus -creator of Mankind- stole a spark from Zeus' lighningbolt, touched it to a reed and gave it to humanity.  <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prometheus" id="ref5">5</a></sup>

Plato believed that the name Prometheus derrived from Pro (before) + manthano (intelligence).  <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prometheus" id="ref6">6</a></sup>

The discovery of fire was a turning point for humanity.
Fire provided warmth, protection, light and the possibility of cooked food. Fire allowed for human geographic dispersal and the expansion of human activity into the dark. <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_of_fire_by_early_humans1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>

Maybe the Promethean myth uses fire to describe that creative human spark which led to civilization culture and technology.

In the neat little squares on the screen, we are looking into the same fires that the ancestors of our ancient ancestors did. In wanting to control the computer, we are facing the same challenge of imagination they did.

This is what we've always done.

zero and one.


0          1

This is really all your computer can know.
In a way, it's all you need to know- in that everything from this point onward is reducable to 0 and 1.  So let's look closely, and really see how much we know about 0 and 1.


Eat code with your brain.
0, of all the languages of all the world, you had to wwwalk into this 1.
