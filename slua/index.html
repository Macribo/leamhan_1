                <p>Games, in all of their fantastic variety, are advanced forms of play. Games have rules and objectives. Some
                    games are new, others have been played since ancient times. Recently, humans have begun to play
                    <em>computer</em>
                    games. But what does it mean to play?
                </p>

            <div class="play">
                <h3>Play</h3>
                <p>
                    Many animals play. </p>
                <div id="ul-aligner">
                    <ul>
                        <li>Dolphins</li>
                        <li>Cats</li>
                        <li>Wolves</li>
                        <li>Rats</li>

                <p>
                    Play might have a practical evolutionary function.
                    <br/> If so, what is the significance of computer assisted play?</p>

                <h3>Computer Games</h3>
                <p>
                    I started playing computer games when I was 5 years old. For over 30 years I've witnessed incredible advances in game-play
                    and graphics. I've noticed something which I want to exploit:
                </p>
                <p>Video games are almost entirely meaningless.
                    <br /> Sure they're fun, they're impressive too.
                    <br /> But they exist at an amazing point of convergence: a frontier where the ancient instincts we share with
                    wolves and deer
                    <b>collide</b> with modern technology.
                    <br/> This sounds like a big deal.</p>
                <p>So why are computer games
                    <em>merely</em> entertainment?
                </p>

                <p> </p>
                <p>Video games are big business. The goal is money, not human progress. Therefore developers are inclined to
                    make 'better' versions of established games. Innovation tends to occur within the constraints of established formulae.  Truely playful innovation tends to occur after the 'type' of game has been determined.</p>

                        <i>Par consequence</i></span>, the experience of play delivered by computer-games today has little more value than it did 30 years
